# TMDB-Group-Project 
## This is a project I did along with my wonderful team mates: Yevegnii, Nelly, Muhammad, and Kanar.
The program we made gets a movie name and returns a poster!
It saves the poster in MongoDB for caching porposes. 

# Please follow the recommended setup on this repo: https://github.com/HadarNeu/UserData-WebApp.git
# Enjoy! :)
